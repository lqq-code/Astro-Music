This is an example project that demonstrates the use of Astro and React to build a web application. It includes features like smooth scrolling animations and scaling effects for images, titles, and descriptions. Below you'll find a brief guide on how to set up and run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

- Node.js (v20.0.0 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lqq-code/Astro3.0-React-SSR.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Astro-Music
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server and make your application accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src`: Contains the source code of the application.
- `public`: Contains public assets like images and fonts.
- `dist`: The build output, generated when building the project.
